"""The error taxonomy, which is the safety-critical part of this library.

What each class means for the money involved:

    RequestRefused    nothing was sent. The note is untouched.
    ServiceRejected   the SERVICE processed the request and refused it.
                      Definitive.
    AmbiguousMint     the outcome is unknown. The request MAY have been
                      processed. Nothing may be assumed either way.
    ProtocolError     a non-mutating response did not match the spec.
    UnverifiableNote  a MUTATION landed and the SERVICE withheld a signature
                      it owed: a cp1 output's certificate, or a hash output's
                      Part 1 signature when the policy asks for one. The note
                      exists; it just cannot be verified offline.

Treating an ambiguous failure as a definitive one is how wallets lose money:
a rotate that times out after the SERVICE burned the input has already
minted the output, and the fresh secret the caller generated is the only
copy of it in existence.
