"""LUD-25's ``m/139'`` branch derivation: the BIP-32 walk from a wallet's cash
root down to a per-SERVICE domain node, exactly as Part 2's "Seed &
derivation" section specifies it::

    cashHashingKey   = derive(masterKey, m/139'/0)
    domainMaterial   = hmacSha256(cashHashingKey, full SERVICE domain)
    (d1, d2, d3, d4) = first 16 bytes of domainMaterial as 4 uint32
    domainNode       = derive(masterKey, m/139'/d1/d2/d3/d4)

"exactly as LUD-05", says the draft of the middle two lines, and that
reference settles the one thing the path shape leaves open. ``d1..d4`` are raw
uint32 drawn from a hash, and BIP-32 already reads any index >= 2^31 as
hardened, so roughly half of any given mint's four levels are hardened by
magnitude alone. They are used exactly as they fall: nothing is masked, and
nothing is forced hardened. That is what LUD-05's own corpus does with the same
four longs, and what the reference wallet does.

An implementation that masks the top bit, or hardens all four, derives a
different tree from every conforming wallet - and a restore against it finds
nothing, silently, and only once the money is gone.

Part 1 secrets are NOT derived from this node, or from the seed at all -
Part 1's own text has WALLET generate plain randomness. An earlier
reference-wallet extension did derive Part 1 secrets deterministically from a
sibling of this branch, hardened at the note's own index; it has since been
dropped as unspecified, and this module no longer provides it.
:mod:`~lnurlcash_kit.secrets`' legacy scheme (HMAC-SHA256 under
``lnurlcash-note-v1``, predating LUD-25 entirely) is still derived and still
scanned on restore, so nothing already minted under it goes missing.

Part 2's address branch is this exact domain node, for the same host: see
:func:`~lnurlcash_kit.recoverable.derive_cash_address_node`.
